In today’s fast-paced world, managing stress and staying mindful are more important than ever. That’s exactly why I created **PulseMind** — a wellness app designed to help users understand their stress levels, build mindful habits, and reflect through journaling and breathing exercises.

## 🎯 App Overview
PulseMind combines real-time health data with guided features that promote emotional and mental well-being. Core features include:

- 📈 **Stress Score Dashboard** based on HRV, heart rate, and other metrics.
- ✍️ **Daily Journaling** with optional reminders.
- 🧘 **Guided Breathing Exercises** with haptic feedback.
- ⏰ **Customizable Reminders** to build healthy habits.
- 🔄 **Apple Watch Companion** for real-time insights and mindfulness sessions.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
| Component         | Tech Used             |
|------------------|------------------------|
| iOS App          | Swift, SwiftUI         |
| Watch App        | SwiftUI for watchOS    |
| Health Integration | HealthKit            |
| Local Storage    | CoreData, UserDefaults |
| Notifications    | UNUserNotificationCenter |
| In-App Purchase  | StoreKit               |

## 🔍 Key Features and Implementation

### 🧠 Stress Score Calculation
We devised a custom Stress Score Algorithm based on:
- Heart Rate (BPM)
- HRV (SDNN)
- Respiratory Rate
- Sleep Duration

We normalize and weight each factor to derive a score between 0–100, helping users monitor trends and take action early.

```swift
let score = calculateStressScore(hrv: hrv, heartRate: heartRate, ...)
```

### ✍️ Journal + Reminders
Users can log reflections in a private journal stored locally. With one tap, they can enable a Daily Reminder.

```swift
NotificationManager.shared.scheduleDailyReminder(...)
```

### 🧘 Breathing Coach (with haptics)
The breathing module helps users focus using “Inhale / Exhale” prompts. Haptic cues and animated visuals enhance the experience.

```swift
WKInterfaceDevice.current().play(.directionUp)
```

### ⌚ Watch Integration
Includes:
- Dashboard with real-time metrics
- Breathing session control
- Haptic & animated feedback

Custom UI with `ScrollView` to avoid layout issues near the digital crown.

## 🧪 Challenges and Learnings
- **Background thread publishing**: Ensured HealthKit fetches run on main queue.
- **Watch UI quirks**: Redesigned layout to prevent clipping.
- **Notification testing**: Validated schedules and permissions.

## 💰 Monetization Strategy
While PulseMind is free, we plan to add a one-time unlock for:
- Advanced trend charts
- AI-based journaling prompts
- Audio-guided breathing

## 🔒 Privacy-First Approach
We do not collect or upload personal or health data. Everything is stored **on-device**.

## 📝 What’s Next
- Add interactive charts
- Android version (Kotlin Multiplatform)
- iOS 17+ mental health insights
- ML-based personalization

## 🚀 Final Thoughts
Building PulseMind has been a fulfilling journey. I hope it inspires others to explore mindful UX and meaningful tech.
