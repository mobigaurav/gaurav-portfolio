# How I Built the Stock Predictor App

In this post, I walk through how I used AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and an LSTM model deployed with SageMaker to build a real-time stock prediction app.

## Technologies Used

- Python (LSTM model)
- AWS Lambda
- Next.js
- SwiftUI
- React Native

## Lessons Learned

- Use Amazon Comprehend for built-in NLP
- Model retraining needs to be efficient
